# CSS Selectors

This is a clone of [CSS Diner](https://flukeout.github.io/), a fun game by [@flukeout](http://www.twitter.com/flukeout) to learn and practice CSS selectors. This app was made as a learning project of [RSSchool JS/Frontend](https://rs.school/js/) course. If you're interested, here is the [link](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/blob/master/tasks/rs-css.md) to the detailed description of the task.

You can play the game [here](https://ivan-gav.github.io/css-selectors/). 

Technology stack:
- TypeScript
- HTML/CSS
- Webpack
- ESlint

The application is SPA.
